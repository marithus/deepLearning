    "By general definition, fashion is a popular way of dressing during a particular time. As thechanges made in fashion are very much affected by time, which can refer to seasonal periods(summer, winter, autumn, spring), different fashion eras or even different fashion styles/choices from Retro to Androgynous fashion. The word 'Fashion' we are using here is a broad term which constantly upgrades and changes itself, older styles can come back as the new trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality and quantity may be a limiting factor when performing an in-depth analysis on all fashion data. Hence, this project would be using a smaller and broader defined set of fashion data that would be more relatable and easily understood by the general population. Although,the data may by limited in quantity and quality, it is much easier understood when looking at it from a broader perspective.\n",
